# Basic Raytracer

This is my attempt to implement the basic raytracer explained by Gabriel Gambetta in his book [Computer Graphics from Scratch](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html).

It will be implemented using Win32 API and C/C++, and maybe I'll try to port it to Mac OS X.
